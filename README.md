# Hi! 

> Many people find it hard to pronounce my name, so a trick to it is to call me bunnies with "P"! I am a second-year Software Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo :)I love to improve and customize the project that I work on. I can assure you I came across and was almost responsible for half of the bugs human kinds have ever seen. Thus, believe it or not, I got pretty good with debugging. A wise man said: “It is not a bug. It is a feature.” Working with these types of "features" sometimes advances a project to its maximum potential!
